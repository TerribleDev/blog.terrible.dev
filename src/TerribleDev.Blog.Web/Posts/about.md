I am a software engineer. I currently work at [Quala](https://www.quala.io). I have worked on all area's of the stack. From a sysadmin, network engineer, backend developer, and frontend developer. I've helped build some extremely large scale websites such as [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.com) and [CarGurus](https://www.cargurus.com). I have a passion for high performing software, devops, and front end. I am a huge fan of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp), [Golang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)), and [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)).

I blog about my general pains building software.
