I've been working at [CarGurus.com](https://www.cargurus.com) for the last 2 years or so. One of the biggest journeys we've been undertaking is to take accessibility far more seriously. However with an engineering team way into the triple digits it gets harder and harder to scale accessibility knowledge.

On top of the knowledge gaps CarGurus has a multitude of technologies UI are build with. The two major are [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). I manage one of our infrastructure teams, we build tools and technologies to create the site with. This includes our component library, our build systems, linting tools, authentication systems, and core utilities for product development. When we first started really taking accessibility seriously we went to several teams in the business. Many of them did not have anyone with accessibility expertise. Our first approach was to teach accessibility. At the same time we worked with our brand marketing team to ensure our color pallet would be accessible from the start.
