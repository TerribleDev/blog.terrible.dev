The code for [blog.terrible.dev](https://blog.terrible.dev). My blog powered by a bespoke blog engine, at one time I thought I'd try to make an open source product for dotnet core, but then got lazy. Probably one of the fastest blog site's you will ever see. Prior to this my blog was built with hugo, and thus authoring was made backward compatible with hugo's posts (3+ years ago). 

## Technology

- dotnet 6
- Markdown
  - [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) for parsing markdown
  - This also has some extensions to ensure all relative links end in `/` and external links have `rel="noopener"` and `target="_blank"`, also to include a picture tag for webp images
- YML for configuring a blog's posts *front matter* aka configuration
- PWA/Serviceworkers


## Authoring

Authoring is done in markdown. Configuration for a post must be at the top of the document and placed before `---` (three dashes). Posts include a `<!-- more -->` tag to indicate where the post should be cut off for the summary.

## Convert images to webp (TODO: make this automatic)

find . -iname '*.png' -exec  cwebp -lossless '{}' -o '{}'.webp \;
find . -iname '*.jpg' -exec  cwebp '{}' -o '{}'.webp \;
find . -iname '*.gif' -exec  gif2webp -mixed '{}' -o '{}'.webp \;


## resize image to max width (TODO: Also make this automatic ðŸ¤£)

find . -iname '*' -exec  convert '{}' -resize 750 '{}' \;
